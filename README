-------------------------------------------

 First, you will need to install
 1. Maven  (for server code)
 2. PHP 5.4.0 or higher  (for the web server)
 3. MySql database
 
 Once you cloned the repo, run the following commands under
 dataset/ folder :

 1. mvn dependency:copy-dependencies (Downloads dependencies)

 2. mvn compile (Compiles java server code)

 3. sh startServer.sh  (starts java xmlrpc server)

 4. php -S localhost:5000 (starts webserver, should be replaced by a 
    better web server for deployment)

 5. Start MySQL database with 

    mysql.server start

 6. To initialize database, run

    sh initDatabase.sh
    
  7. Download the ace parser (Linux x64 Binaries can be found here 
  	 http://sweaglesw.org/linguistics/ace/ ) and the ERG 1214 grammar file 
  	 (same link). Check the command in GrammarCheck.java for exact files
  	 needed and their location.	  

 The server is now live, and can accept questions, and show existing 
 questions. Open your browser and migrate to 

 localhost:5000/src/main/java/server/index.php
