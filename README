 First, you will need to install
 1. Maven  (for server code)
 2. PHP 5.4.0 or higher  (for the web server)
 3. MySql database

 Once you cloned the repo, run the following commands under
 dataset/ folder :

 1. mvn dependency:copy-dependencies (Downloads dependencies)

 2. mvn compile (Compiles java server code)

 3. sh startServer.sh  (starts java xmlrpc server)

 4. php -S localhost:5000 (starts webserver, should be replaced by a 
    better web server for deployment)

 5. Install mysql server, and start it with 

    mysql.server start

 6. To initialize database, run

    sh initDatabase.sh

 The server is now live, and can accept questions, and show existing 
 questions. Open your browser and migrate to 

 localhost:5000/src/main/java/server/index.php
